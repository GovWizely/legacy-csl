Following the entry into force of the Agreement on July 4, 2012, President Obama designated Afghanistan a Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) on July 6, 2012. Afghanistan is the first country to be designated an MNNA since 2004.<\/p>\r\n<p>The SPA marked the culmination of over 10 years of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan. During that time, the core U.S. goal in Afghanistan has been to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaida and its affiliates, and to prevent their return to Afghanistan.<\/p>\r\n<p>At the July 2012 Tokyo Conference, the United States and other international partners committed to continue providing extraordinary development assistance to Afghanistan through the 2014 transition and the ensuing transformational decade. The U.S. Government continues to support a broad-based government in Afghanistan, representative of all Afghans. Afghan forces have taken or are transitioning to take the lead in combat operations, with International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF) supporting through advisory and enabling roles. The transition of full security responsibility for Afghanistan from ISAF to Afghan forces will be complete by the end of 2014.<\/p>\r\n<p>On September 30, 2014, the United States and Afghanistan signed a Bilateral Security Agreement allowing the United States to continue after 2014 to train, advise, and assist Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) in their ongoing mission to prevent terrorists from threatening Afghanistan, the region, and the world from Afghan soil. Earlier on the same day, the United States, Afghanistan, and our NATO allies signed the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, ensuring that international efforts to train, advise, and assist the ANSF will also continue after the conclusion of ISAF&rsquo;s mission at the end of 2014.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>U.S. Assistance to Afghanistan<\/b><\/p>\r\n<p>The United States has made a long-term commitment to help Afghanistan build a secure state with a democratic government that respects human rights. Through the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework, the United States and other international donors committed to providing Afghanistan $16 billion in aid through 2015 and continuing assistance at levels commensurate with the last decade through 2017. In its turn, Afghanistan committed to strengthening governance, building a legislative framework to ensure a credible, transparent and inclusive transfer of power, and making the structural changes to ensure that the government remains solvent and Afghan citizens can participate in a growing economy. The United States and others in the international community currently support Afghanistan with a broad array of assistance programs including private sector growth, capacity-building for government institutions, support to improve professionalism of security forces, programs to support civil society and respect for human rights, counter-narcotic programs, infrastructure projects, special support for the advancement of Afghan women and girls, and humanitarian relief.<\/p>\r\n<p>The United States supports the Afghan government&#39;s goals of focusing on reintegration and reconciliation, economic development, improving relations with Afghanistan&rsquo;s regional partners, and steadily increasing the security capability of Afghan forces. The United States is using a bilateral incentive program and the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework to hold the Afghan Government accountable and to encourage it to take actions to combat corruption and improve governance and to provide better services for the people of Afghanistan, while maintaining and expanding on the important democratic reforms and advances in women&rsquo;s rights that have been made since 2001.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Bilateral Economic Relations<\/b><\/p>\r\n<p>Afghanistan signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with the United States in 2004.There is no Bilateral Taxation Treaty between the United States and Afghanistan.

Post-independence, Angola saw 27 years of civil war among groups backed at various times by countries that included the United States, the Soviet Union, Cuba, China, and South Africa. Angola has had two presidents since independence. The first president came to power in 1975; upon his 1979 death, the second president assumed power. Multiparty elections were held in 1992 under a process supervised by the United Nations, but the results were disputed and civil war continued until the 2002 death of one holdout guerilla leader. A new constitution was adopted in 2010 and elections were held in 2012.<\/p>\r\n<p>Angola has a strong and capable military. Although the country is sub-Saharan Africa&#39;s second-largest oil producer and has great agricultural potential, two-thirds of the population live in poverty. U.S. foreign policy goals in Angola are to promote and strengthen Angola&rsquo;s democratic institutions, promote economic prosperity, improve health, and consolidate peace and security, including maritime security. The United States has worked with Angola to remove thousands of landmines and help war refugees and internally displaced people return to their homes.<\/p>\r\n<p>In 2009 Secretary Clinton declared Angola a &ldquo;strategic partner&rdquo; of the United States, one of three that the Obama Administration has identified on the African continent (the other two are Nigeria and South Africa). The U.S. &ndash; Angola Strategic Partnership Dialogue (SPD) was formalized with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in Washington in July 2010. Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Chikoti met for the first high level Strategic Dialogue in December 2014 in Washington, D.C. Secretary Kerry met President dos Santos during his visit to Luanda in May 2014.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>U.S. Assistance to Angola<\/b><\/p>\r\n<p>U.S. assistance seeks to focus on preventing major infectious diseases, strengthening health systems, increasing access to family planning and reproductive health services, and building capacity within nongovernmental organizations working in health advocacy and health service delivery. U.S. assistance also promotes stabilization and security sector reform.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Bilateral Economic Relations<\/b><\/p>\r\n<p>Angola is the third-largest trading partner of the United States in sub-Saharan Africa, mainly because of its petroleum exports.

Post-independence, Angola saw 27 years of civil war among groups backed at various times by countries that included the United States, the Soviet Union, Cuba, China, and South Africa. Angola has had two presidents since independence. The first president came to power in 1975; upon his 1979 death, the second president assumed power. Multiparty elections were held in 1992 under a process supervised by the United Nations, but the results were disputed and civil war continued until the 2002 death of one holdout guerilla leader. A new constitution was adopted in 2010 and elections were held in 2012.<\/p>\r\n<p>Angola has a strong and capable military. Although the country is sub-Saharan Africa&#39;s second-largest oil producer and has great agricultural potential, two-thirds of the population live in poverty. U.S. foreign policy goals in Angola are to promote and strengthen Angola&rsquo;s democratic institutions, promote economic prosperity, improve health, and consolidate peace and security, including maritime security. The United States has worked with Angola to remove thousands of landmines and help war refugees and internally displaced people return to their homes.<\/p>\r\n<p>In 2009 Secretary Clinton declared Angola a &ldquo;strategic partner&rdquo; of the United States, one of three that the Obama Administration has identified on the African continent (the other two are Nigeria and South Africa). The U.S. &ndash; Angola Strategic Partnership Dialogue (SPD) was formalized with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding in Washington in July 2010. Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Chikoti met for the first high level Strategic Dialogue in December 2014 in Washington, D.C. Secretary Kerry met President dos Santos during his visit to Luanda in May 2014.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>U.S. Assistance to Angola<\/b><\/p>\r\n<p>U.S. assistance seeks to focus on preventing major infectious diseases, strengthening health systems, increasing access to family planning and reproductive health services, and building capacity within nongovernmental organizations working in health advocacy and health service delivery. U.S. assistance also promotes stabilization and security sector reform.<\/p>\r\n<p><b>Bilateral Economic Relations<\/b><\/p>\r\n<p>Angola is the third-largest trading partner of the United States in sub-Saharan Africa, mainly because of its petroleum exports. U.S. imports from Angola are dominated by petroleum, with some diamonds. &nbsp;U.S. exports to Angola include machinery, aircraft, poultry, and iron and steel products.
