**Introduction**

China attracted $105.7 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2010, second only to the United States. China's sustained high economic growth rate and the expansion of its domestic market help explain its attractiveness as an FDI destination. However, foreign investors often temper their optimism regarding potential investment returns with uncertainty about China's willingness to offer a level playing field to foreign investors in the long term. In addition, foreign investors face a range of difficulties related to China's current investment climate. These include industrial policies that protect and promote state-owned and other domestic firms, equity caps and other restrictions on foreign ownership in many industries, weak intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, a lack of transparency, corruption and an unreliable legal system.

China has a legal and regulatory framework granting it the authority to promote investment in specific regions or industries it wishes to develop and to restrict foreign investment deemed not to be in its national interest or that might compete with state-condoned monopolies or other favored domestic firms. Many regulations contain undefined key terms and standards and are applied in an inconsistent manner. Potential investment restrictions are much broader than those of many developed countries, including the United States.

**Investment Policies**

The Chinese Government has stated that it welcomes foreign investment. In particular, China seeks to promote investment in higher value-added sectors, including high technology research and development, advanced manufacturing, clean energy technology, and select modern services sectors. Export-oriented investments also often receive government support. A major goal of China's investment policies is to encourage the domestic development of technological innovation and know-

how. Investment projects that involve the transfer of technology or the potential for "indigenous innovation" tend to be favorably received by China's investment authorities. Foreign investors have said they must often weigh China's market potential and its interest in attracting technology against China's inability or unwillingness to protect investors' intellectual property.

China has indicated that it plans to restrict foreign investment in resource-intensive and highly-polluting industries, citing basic manufacturing as an example. In addition, China appears to discourage foreign investments in sectors: 1) where China seeks to develop domestic firms into globally competitive multinational corporations; 2) that have benefited historically from state-authorized monopolies or from a legacy of state investment; or 3) deemed key to social stability. It also discourages investments that are intended to profit from currency, real estate, or asset speculation.

China seeks to spread the benefits of foreign investment beyond its relatively wealthy coastal areas by encouraging foreign companies to establish regional headquarters and operations in Central, Western, and Northeastern China. China publishes and regularly revises a Catalogue of Priority Industries for Foreign Investment in the Central-Western Regions, which outlines incentives to attract investment in targeted sectors to those parts of China.

**Five-Year Plan**

China defines its broad economic goals through five-year macro-economic plans. The most significant of these for foreign investors is China's Five-Year Plan on Foreign Capital Utilization. The most recent version was released in November 2006 and promised greater scrutiny of foreign investment projects. The plan called on China to: 1) realize a "fundamental shift" from quantity to quality in foreign investment by 2010; 2) focus on introducing advanced technology, management expertise and talent; 3) pay attention to the environment and energy efficiency when evaluating investments for government approval; 4) restrict foreigners' acquisition of "dragon head" enterprises (i.e., premier Chinese firms); 5) prevent the "emergence or expansion of foreign capital monopolies;" 6) protect "national economic security," particularly "industrial security;" and 7) prevent the "abuse of intellectual property rights protection not favorable to the indigenous innovation of Chinese enterprises." The next plan is expected to be released in 2012.

**Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment in Industries**

China outlines its specific foreign investment objectives primarily through its Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment in Industries, most recently revised in December 2011. The catalogue delineates sectors of the economy where foreign investment is "encouraged," "restricted" and "prohibited." Investment in sectors not listed in the catalogue is considered permitted. China "encourages" investment in sectors where it believes it will benefit from foreign assistance or technology. Investment is "restricted" and "prohibited" in sectors that China deems sensitive, that touch on national security, or which do not meet the goals of China's economic development plans. The catalogue notes many sectors where equity caps limit foreign ownership, often to a minority share, giving Chinese partner firms significant control and allowing them to benefit from technology transfer.

**Problems with the Catalogue**

The catalogue reflects China's market access restrictions. Contradictions between the catalogue and other measures have confused investors and added to the perception that investment guidelines do not provide a secure basis for business planning. Even in encouraged and permitted sectors, regulations apart from the catalogue often detail additional restrictions on the specific forms of investment that are allowed. Chinese regulators are not bound to follow the catalogue and instead maintain the flexibility to ignore its guidance and restrict or approve foreign investment for other reasons. China may also adopt new regulations or make unannounced policy decisions that supersede the most recently published edition of the catalogue. Uncertainty as to which industries are being promoted and how long such designations will be valid undermines confidence in the stability and predictability of the investment climate.

**Chinaâ€™s Foreign Investment Approval Regime**

According to the Interim Measures for the Administration of Examining and Approving Foreign Investment Projects, issued in October 2004 and still in effect, all proposed foreign investments in China must be submitted for approval to the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) or to provincial or local Development and Reform Commissions, depending on the sector and value of the investment. NDRC's approval process includes assessing the project's compliance with China's laws and regulations, its national security implications, and its economic development ramifications. In some cases, NDRC also solicits the opinions of relevant Chinese industrial regulators and "consulting agencies," which may include industry associations that represent domestic firms. The State Council may also weigh in for high-value projects in "restricted" sectors.

Once NDRC approves a project, investors apply to the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) for approval to legally establish a company. MOFCOM (or, depending on the sector and value of the investment, the provincial or local Department of Commerce) is responsible for three reviews: 1) a review of all foreign investment in China; 2) an anti-monopoly review of certain mergers and acquisitions; and 3) a security review of certain mergers and acquisitions. Foreign investors next apply for a business license from the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC), which allows the firm to operate. Once a license is obtained, the investor registers with China's tax and foreign exchange agencies. Greenfield investment projects must also seek approval from China's Environmental Protection Ministry and its Ministry of Land Resources.

**Mergers and Acquisitions and the Anti-Monopoly Law**

MOFCOM's Anti-Monopoly Bureau reviews mergers and acquisitions (M&A) above a certain threshold and meeting certain criteria specified in China's Anti-Monopoly Law (AML). While the AML calls for evaluation of the merger's effect on competition, it also allows antitrust regulators to consider factors other than consumer welfare. The AML states that China will protect the "lawful activities" of state-regulated monopolies and state-owned enterprises (SOEs).

As of November 2011, MOFCOM had reviewed over 250 M&A transactions, approving 97 percent unconditionally and approving nine transactions with conditions. Seven of the M&A cases approved with conditions involved offshore transactions between foreign parties. As of January 2012, MOFCOM's Anti-Monopoly Bureau had dealt with two American acquisitions of Chinese companies, rejecting one and approving the other.

**Problems with China's Foreign Investment Approval Regime and the Anti-Monopoly Law**

All proposed foreign investments in China are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, allowing significant discretion on the part of Chinese regulators to impose unexplained restrictions on new investment projects and to take into account the interests of domestic competitors. This ad hoc system diminishes the transparency of China's investment regulations and adds to investor uncertainty. Although the law does not expressly state that joint ventures fall under its scope, MOFCOM requires joint ventures to submit notification under the AML. AML implementation also suffers from a lack of decision-making transparency. MOFCOM decisions to block or conditionally clear proposed M&A transactions are the only administrative decisions required to be publicized, so the majority of MOFCOM reviews have left no public record. MOFCOM's published decisions are brief and often provide little substantive analysis.

**Merger & Acquisition Security Review**

In February 2011, China released the State Council Notice Regarding the Establishment of a Security Review Mechanism for Foreign Investors Acquiring Domestic Enterprises. The notice established an interagency Joint Conference, led by NDRC and MOFCOM, with the authority to block foreign mergers and acquisitions of domestic firms that it believes may have an impact on national security. The Joint Conference is instructed to consider not just national defense security but also national economic security and basic social order implications when reviewing transactions. Some provincial and municipal departments of commerce have posted on the internet a Security Review Industry Table that lists industries not related to defense potentially subject to this review mechanism; however, MOFCOM has declined to confirm that this list reflects official Chinese policy.

**Investment Restrictions in "Vital Industries and Key Fields"**

The December 2006 "Guiding Opinions Concerning the Advancement of Adjustments of State Capital and the Restructuring of State-Owned Enterprises" called on China to consolidate and develop its state-owned economy, including enhancing its control and influence in "vital industries and key fields relating to national security and national economic lifelines." The document defined "vital industries and key fields" as "industries concerning national security, major infrastructure and important mineral resources, industries that provide essential public goods and services, and key enterprises in pillar industries and high-tech industries."

The Chairman of the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), when the document was published, listed industries in which the state should maintain "absolute control" (aviation, coal, defense, electric power and the state grid, oil and petrochemicals, shipping, and telecommunications) and "relative control" (automotive, chemical, construction, exploration and design, electronic information, equipment manufacturing, iron and steel, nonferrous metal, and science and technology). China maintains that these lists do not reflect its official policy.

China's State Assets Law is intended to safeguard China's economic system, promote the "socialist market economy," fortify and develop the state-owned economy, and enable SOEs to play a leading role in China's economy, especially in "vital industries and key fields." The law requires China to adopt policies to encourage SOE concentration and dominance in industries vital to national security and "national economic security."

**Additional Laws Related to Foreign Investment**

China's State Secrets Law gives the government broad authority to classify information as a "state secret," creating uncertainty and potential risk for investors negotiating with

SOEs or operating in sensitive sectors. The Contract Law encourages contractual compliance by providing legal recourse, although enforcement of judgments continues to be a problem. Additional investment-related laws include but are not limited to: the Administrative Permissions Law; the Arbitration Law; the Corporate Income Tax Law; the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law; the Foreign Trade Law; the Government Procurement Law; the Insurance Law; the Labor Contract Law; the Law on Import and Export of Goods; and the Securities Law.
